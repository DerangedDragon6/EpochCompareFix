WARING: Not fully tested, Made for my own personal use

EpochCompareFix is a lightweight World of Warcraft 3.3.5 addon designed for the Project Epoch client.
On Project Epoch, the default client does not calculate item stat differences correctly when using the Shift + Compare function (hovering an item while holding Shift). This addon restores proper calculations so gear comparisons display accurate values.

Features

Corrects item comparison math when holding Shift.

Ensures displayed stats match the item’s actual values in Project Epoch.

Lightweight, minimal code – no configuration needed.

Not Tested with other addons

Feel free to use this code and modify as needed to improve
